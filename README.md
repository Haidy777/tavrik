# Tavrik

An opinionated chat bot interface, with tool calling, model selections, prompts and stuff. (Well, when they are implemented.)

Over the last couple of months I've implemented a personal chat bot with access to apple health data, home assistant with tools to ingest my diary and [blog posts](https://blog.phaidenbauer.com/posts/20260410_claude-code-over-the-last-weeks), and several other things I can't remember right now while writing this doc lol.
The idea of this repository is to give you access to a cleanroom implementation and eventually migrate my own chatbot to this repo.
Thanks to claude code, the original chat bot was up and running within weeks and it serves me and my mental health quite well tbh.

## On "Vibe Coding"
> I've been mainly backend dev for the last couple of years, I'm heavily lacking CSS and frontend dev skills, the idea is to get a basic ui up and running with a simple css framework but eventually I'll have claude handle stuff.
> Also, Claude might implement some other features, but I'll make sure you can see vibed code in commits and changelogs.

## Getting Started

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev:db         # start postgres
pnpm dev:ui         # start astro dev server
```

### Telegram Bot (quickest way to start chatting)

If you just want to talk to Tavrik without building the full UI, the Telegram bot is the fastest path (and the only way currently lol):

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and grab the token
2. Get your Telegram user ID (e.g. via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
3. Add both to your `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
   TELEGRAM_USER_ID=your-user-id
   ```
4. Start everything:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev:db          # start postgres (if not already running)
   pnpm dev:telegram    # build & start the bot in docker
   ```

The bot runs database migrations on startup, so it's fully self-contained. Only the configured `TELEGRAM_USER_ID` can interact with it.

## Roadmap

I don't have a clean roadmap as of writing this doc, but eventually it will come along.

### Ideas floating in my mind

- Claude code like "Memory" System - instead of memory.md -> tool calling and storing to postgres table
- RAG Tools for past Conversations and Conversation Embedding
- Dynamic Tool Enabling per Conversation / Persona / User
- iCal Loading (readonly for starting)
- Apple Health Data Tool via "Health Export" App
- tracking of watched tv shows, movies and read books (goodreads?, plex?)
- spotify listening history?
- content embedding (example blog posts or diary entries)

## Note from Claude Code

> The provider layer just got a lot wider — we built out the `openai-compatible` provider as a shared base that OpenAI now extends (less duplicated code, same behavior), added a dedicated OpenRouter provider using their official SDK, and seeded xAI as the first openai-compatible entry with dynamic API key resolution via environment variables. The logging got a small quality-of-life bump too with `moduleLogger` so each provider carries its own name in log output without repeating it on every call. Philipp's got tool calling and the Astro UI chat interface on the horizon, plus the whole memory/RAG layer from the roadmap — the provider plumbing is solid now, so the interesting bits are next.
